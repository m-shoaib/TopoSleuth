## Data Files Description

### 1. `lldp_events.csv`
**Source**: Ryu controller EventOFPPacketIn events
**Fields**:
- `event_id`: Unique identifier for each LLDP event
- `timestamp`: Microsecond-precision timestamp
- `src_dpid`, `dst_dpid`: Source and destination switch DPIDs
- `attack_type`: Attack type (empty for normal traffic)
- `detected`: Whether TopoSec detected this as an attack
- `decoy_link_hit`: Whether this involved a decoy link
- Additional packet metadata

**Collection Notes**:
- Sampled all LLDP packets received by controller
- Timestamps synchronized via NTP
- Includes 0.5% packet loss due to network conditions

### 2. `detections.csv`
**Source**: TopoSec detection modules
**Fields**:
- `detection_id`: Unique detection record ID
- `attack_type`: Type of attack detected
- `latency_ms`: Detection latency
- `dc_confidence`, `lba_score`, etc.: Module confidence scores
- `modules_involved`: Which modules contributed to detection
- `action_taken`: Response action (quarantine, alert, etc.)

**Collection Notes**:
- Recorded when any TopoSec module flags an anomaly
- Includes both true positives and false positives
- Confidence scores normalized to 0-1 range

### 3. `link_state.csv`
**Source**: Topology Manager module
**Fields**:
- `link_id`: Switch:port-switch:port identifier
- `state`: Current link state (active, quarantined, etc.)
- `confidence_score`: Confidence in link validity
- `reason`: Why state changed
- `decision`: Accept or reject the link

**Collection Notes**:
- Updated on topology changes
- Includes manual interventions by experimenters
- Confidence scores from multiple validators

### 4. `performance_metrics.csv`
**Source**: System monitoring tools
**Fields**:
- `measurement_type`: normal_operation, under_attack, or recovery
- `cpu_overhead_percent`: Controller CPU usage
- `memory_usage_mb`: Controller memory consumption
- `network_overhead_kbps`: Additional traffic from TopoSec
- `detection_latency_mean`: Average detection latency

**Collection Notes**:
- Sampled every 30 seconds during experiments
- Averages calculated over 1-minute windows
- Baseline established during normal operation

### 5. `decoy_link_analysis.csv`
**Source**: Decoy Checker module logs
**Fields**:
- `decoy_link_id`: Identifier for fake link
- `hit_count`: Number of times attackers used this decoy
- `attack_types_detected`: Which attacks were caught
- `detection_latency_avg_ms`: Average detection time
- `confidence_score`: Always 1.0 for decoy hits

**Collection Notes**:
- Generated post-experiment from decoy hit logs
- Includes effectiveness metrics per decoy link
- Used to optimize decoy placement strategy

### 6. `experiment_artifacts.csv`
**Source**: Experiment monitoring and manual logging
**Fields**:
- `artifact_type`: Type of anomaly (controller_restart, etc.)
- `severity`: Impact level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- `description`: Human-readable description
- `duration_seconds`: How long artifact persisted

**Collection Notes**:
- Manually logged during experiments
- Includes both expected and unexpected events
- Used to filter or annotate affected data periods

## Data Quality Measures

### Validation Checks
1. **Temporal Consistency**: Timestamps monotonic within tolerance
2. **Value Ranges**: All numeric values within expected ranges
3. **Referential Integrity**: Cross-references between files valid
4. **Statistical Plausibility**: Distributions match expected patterns

### Cleaning Procedures
- Removed duplicate records (except retransmissions)
- Fixed malformed timestamps (< 0.01% of records)
- Imputed missing values using interpolation (when appropriate)
- Flagged outliers for manual review

### Missing Data Handling
- Packet loss: Represented as gaps in event sequence
- Sensor failures: Interpolated from surrounding values
- Controller restarts: Annotated in artifacts file
- Less than 0.5% of data points affected
