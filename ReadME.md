## 🔬 Experimental Setup

Our experiments were conducted on a testbed with:

- **Controller**: Ryu SDN controller with TopoSec modules
- **Switches**: 20 OpenFlow 1.3 switches
- **Network**: Mininet emulation environment
- **Attacks**: 10 topology attack types (100 instances each)
- **Runs**: 10 experimental runs with different seeds
- **Metrics**: Detection rate, latency, false positives, resource usage

Detailed setup information is available in [`docs/EXPERIMENT_SETUP.md`](docs/EXPERIMENT_SETUP.md).
